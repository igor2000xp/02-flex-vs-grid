# FLEX vs. GRID.

Practical examples of CSS FLEX and CSS GRID modules. The difference between FLEX and GRID in practice.

In this lesson, I will talk about the difference and common features of flex (flexbox) and grid modules, and in practice I will show options for implementing flex and grid modules with popular designs, such as: pressing the footer to the bottom of the page, displaying elements with an arbitrary size, displaying text with a pseudo-element, displaying non-constant elements of different sizes, displaying identical content elements, displaying elements in a checkerboard pattern, displaying elements according to a pattern, displaying elements in the "Masonry" style.

The lesson is filled with good practices for using CSS FLEX and CSS GRID modules, live hooks, and solving various problems that arise.
